# Internship summary

The goal is to create a system that allows customers to create a quotation automaticaly based directly on the command that they made. The main langages use are Python (with django (so HTML and CSS will be used too)) and LaTeX.

Recap:

## Day 1 : 19/06/2023

### MORNING:

Following a tutorial found directly on django website, I got to use it and practice with data bases and user registration.

### AFTERNOON:

I finish the tutorial, everything is inside the DjangoFirstUse folder.
All the code was given during the tutorial but I understood most of it (some details are still a bit foggy but I'll look at them this evening).


## Day 2 : 20/06/2023

### MORNING:

I created the database in a basic way to test some function on them and to debug stuff. Everything seems to work just fine.

### AFTERNOON:

I modified the database to be more precise with what it will end up beeing. Currently, nothing has been tested because the code to put everything on the site is not yet updated. It will probably be done this evening or tomorrow morning.

## DAY : 21/06/2023
