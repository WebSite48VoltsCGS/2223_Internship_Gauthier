# Internship summary

Recap:

## Day 1 : 19/06/2023

### MORNING:

Following a tutorial found directly on django website, I got to use it and practice with data bases and user registration.

### AFTERNOON:

I finish the tutorial, everything is inside the DjangoFirstUse folder.
All the code was given during the tutorial but I understood most of it (some details are still a bit foggy but I'll look at them this evening).


## Day 2 : 20/06/2023

### MORNING:

I created the database in a basic way to test some function on them and to debug stuff. Everything seems to work just fine.

### AFTERNOON:

I modified the database to be more precise with what it will end up beeing. Currently, nothing has been tested because the code to put everything on the site is not yet updated. It will probably be done this evening or tomorrow morning.

## DAY 3: 21/06/2023

### MORNING AND AFTERNOON:

The day was spent working on the database, a lot of problems occured because I was not acquainted to the django syntaxe yet. Everything was back to normal at the end of the day and it mostly only remain to precise a bit more the constraint of the different tables.

## DAY 4: 22/06/2023

### MORNING:

Continue to work on the database. At noon, it was over and just need the specialisation like check if their are no repeating email adresses, etc...

### AFTERNOON:

The database is "finish" for what I know, I'll ask tomorrow if more details need to be added or if I forgot something. Next I'll focus on the extraction of data from the .tex files and how to store them.

## DAY 5: 23/06/2023

### MORNING:

Extract the data from the tex files et work on them to make it easier to transfer them into the csv file.

### AFTERNOON:

Transfer of the data into the csv file. Duplicate and empty field has been taking care of, everything is sorted in an alphabetic order. Last thing to do will be to see how the Name - Brand - etc cell is made to import everything into the database. After what, the database for the product will be over.
