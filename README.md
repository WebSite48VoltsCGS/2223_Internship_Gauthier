Recap:

## Day 1 : 19/06/2023

# MORNING:

Following a tutorial found directly on django website, I got to use it and practice with data bases and user registration.

# AFTERNOON:

I finish the tutorial, everything is inside the DjangoFirstUse folder.
All the code was given during the tutorial but I understood most of it (some details are still a bit foggy but I'll look at them this evening).
